## 🎯 The REAL Problem

**The music industry is broken.**

```
Spotify pays artists: $0.003-$0.005 per stream
         ↓
    1 million streams = $3,000-$5,000
         ↓
    Label takes 80-90%
         ↓
    Artist gets: ~$300-$500
         ↓
    For a MILLION streams.
```

Meanwhile:
- ❌ **Corporations exploit creators** - Keep the majority, provide limited transparency
- ❌ **Users get a bad deal** - Pay monthly subscriptions, but artists still starve
- ❌ **Labels control everything** - Decide what gets promoted, what gets hidden
- ❌ **No real analytics** - Artists don't know WHO loves their music or WHERE
- ❌ **Users worldwide are tired** of being data products for corporations

**But we all want the same thing:**
- 🎵 **Great music** - High quality, accessible, properly attributed
- 💰 **Fair compensation for creators** - Artists deserve the lion's share
- 🔍 **Transparency** - Who's listening, where, why (for artists AND users)
- 🚫 **No corporate middlemen** - Taking 90% and providing 10% value

**The technical problem** (finding good torrents) is trivial compared to the social problem: *How do we create a system where creators actually benefit from people loving their music?*

---

## 🎨 Why This Exists: Empowering Creators, Not Exploiting Them

**The fundamental problem:** Streaming platforms are black boxes. Spotify pays artists $0.003-$0.005 per stream, keeps the lion's share, and provides limited transparency about who's listening, where, or why. Labels take most of what's left. Artists get pennies.

**Our belief:**

> **Artists WANT their music heard worldwide.** More reach = more fans = more shows = actual income.
> **Artists DESERVE transparent compensation** when the network generates revenue.
> **Nobody wants ads.** We hate them too.

### The Vision: Transparent Creator Compensation

│    ✗ Take majority revenue (95% goes to creators)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

**We know the challenge:**
Artists won't upload to a platform without users.
Users won't join a platform without content.
Revenue won't exist without scale.

**Our approach:**

1. **Phase 0 (Now):** Build trust infrastructure with existing torrents
   - Prove the validation model works
   - Create a verified content library through community validation
   - No artist participation required yet

2. **Phase 1 (Next):** Launch creator dashboard (read-only)
   - Artists can see what's being shared (their existing torrents)
   - Full analytics: plays, locations, quality preferences, trending
   - No commitment, just transparency

3. **Phase 2 (Scale):** Opt-in permissions system
   - Artists approve/block specific songs/albums
   - "I'm okay with X album being shared, not Y"
   - Still free for users, builds artist trust

4. **Phase 3 (Revenue):** Paid tier for sustainability
   - Premium features (faster, ad-free, early access)
   - **95% of revenue → Creators** (proportional to plays/validations)
   - **5% → Network** (validators + infrastructure)
   - Artists see every transaction on blockchain

**The bet:** If we build genuine trust infrastructure that respects creators AND users, both will choose to participate when they see it works.

### The Core Insight

**Not expert gatekeeping. Community validation at scale.**

- **Casual Listeners (YOU)** vote on files after listening
- **Core Listeners** validate those votes with cryptographic proof (acoustic fingerprint + spectral analysis)
- **Anyone can progress** from Casual to Core (earn karma → apply → validate)
- **The network is self-governing** — no central authority, no gatekeepers
- **Trust is transparent** — all validation proofs are public and auditable

### Why This Changes Everything

Traditional systems:
- ❌ **Private trackers:** Interviews, invite trees, gatekeeping
- ❌ **Public torrents:** No quality control, decision paralysis
- ❌ **Streaming:** You trust the platform, not the community

**Trust Tune Network:**
- ✅ **Open participation** at your level (Casual or Core)
- ✅ **Community validates quality** with cryptographic proof
- ✅ **Transparent trust** — you can audit the validators
- ✅ **Self-reinforcing** — more users = more validated content
- ✅ **Distributed** — no servers, no central control (Gun.js)

## 🎵 What Karma Player Does Today (v0.1.1)

**Karma Player is Phase 0** — proving the basic search/download flow works, before we add the network.

```
User Query → AI Parse → MusicBrainz → Torrent Search → AI Select → Download
     ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓
   "miles    artist:       MBID:       18+ indexers    Best FLAC
    davis"   Miles Davis   xxx-yyy     (Jackett)       24-bit
```

### Current Features

#### 1. AI-Powered Query Understanding
```bash
poetry run karma-player search "I know you know - Esperanza Spalding"
```

AI parses natural language:
- Identifies: artist, song, album
- Queries **MusicBrainz** for canonical metadata
- Pre-filters albums by checking torrent availability
- Presents only options that actually exist

**Multi-Provider Support:**
- 🟣 **Anthropic Claude** (recommended)
- 🟢 **OpenAI GPT** (fastest, cheapest)
- 🔵 **Google Gemini**

Auto-detects based on your API keys. No configuration.

#### 2. Intelligent Album Matching
```
Query: "fear of the dark iron maiden"
         ↓
MusicBrainz: Found 2 albums
  • Best of the Beast (compilation)
  • The Book of Souls: Live Chapter (live)
         ↓
User selects: Live Chapter
         ↓
System searches 18+ indexers
Finds 26 torrents
         ↓
AI FILTERS: Wrong album? Reject!
         ↓
Result: "The Book of Souls: Live Chapter" (FLAC 1.45GB)
         ✓ Correct album selected
```

No more downloading the wrong version.

#### 3. Quality-First Ranking

AI prioritizes:
```
Priority 1: CORRECT ALBUM (filters wrong albums first)
Priority 2: AUDIO QUALITY (24-bit > 16-bit > 320kbps)
Priority 3: SEEDERS (availability matters)
Priority 4: COMPLETENESS (proper releases > compilations)
```

Quality scoring detects:
- 🎵 Hi-res: DSD, SACD, 24-bit FLAC (192/176/96/88 kHz)
- 💿 Lossless: 16-bit FLAC, ALAC
- 🎸 Vinyl/LP rips (often superior mastering)
- 📀 Standard: 320kbps MP3, V0

#### 4. Smart Auto-Mode

Choose **[4] Just get it for me!** and the system tries strategies:

```
Strategy 1: Try single track
    ↓
  Wrong album detected?
    ↓
  ⚠️  Album mismatch! Continue...
    ↓
Strategy 2: Try full album
    ↓
  ✓ Found correct album!
    ↓
Strategy 3: Try other albums (if needed)
```

AI explains its decision with full reasoning.

#### 5. Top 3 Torrents

```
🧲 Magnet Links (Top 3):

[1] Iron Maiden - The Book Of Souls: Live Chapter (2017) [FLAC] ✓ SELECTED
    Format: FLAC | Size: 1.45 GB | Seeders: 17
    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:...

[2] Iron Maiden - The Book Of Souls: Live Chapter [2CD Japanese]
    Format: FLAC | Size: 755 MB | Seeders: 8
    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:...

[3] Iron Maiden - The Book Of Souls: Live Chapter (Alternative)
    Format: FLAC | Size: 755 MB | Seeders: 8
    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:...
```

Backup options if primary fails.

## 🚀 The Roadmap: From CLI to Trust Network

### Phase 0: ✅ CURRENT (v0.1.x)
**Goal:** Prove basic flow works

What works today:
- ✅ AI query parsing
- ✅ MusicBrainz metadata lookup
- ✅ Multi-indexer torrent search (18+ indexers via Jackett)
- ✅ Album-aware filtering
- ✅ Quality ranking
- ✅ Top 3 recommendations

### Phase 1: Network-First Search (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Add distributed ledger

```
Search Flow Changes:

BEFORE (Phase 0):
User → MusicBrainz → External Indexers → Results

AFTER (Phase 1):
User → MusicBrainz → CHECK NETWORK FIRST → Results
                          ↓
                  Found verified files?
                    ↓              ↓
                   YES            NO
                    ↓              ↓
              Show those    → External Indexers
            (VERIFIED badge)        ↓
                                Merge results
                                    ↓
                        Rank: Verified > Quality > Seeders
```

Adds:
- Gun.js distributed ledger
- Vote tracking (local + network)
- Verified file badges
- Network-first search logic

**Success metric:** 80% of searches hit verified network files

### Phase 2: Two-Tier Validation (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal:** Community validation with proof

```
Vote Validation Flow:

Casual downloads file → Votes (+1/-1)
            ↓
    Vote enters PENDING queue
            ↓
  (visible to Core Listeners)
            ↓
    Core claims validation task
            ↓
  Core already has file?
    Yes → Validate instantly
    No → Download → Validate
            ↓
    Run validation proof:
    • Acoustic fingerprint (Chromaprint)
    • Spectral analysis (detect transcodes)
    • Format verification (ffprobe)
    • Metadata check
    • Sign with Ed25519 key
            ↓
    Core approves OR rejects
            ↓
  Approved: Casual +1 karma, Core +5-15 karma
  Rejected: Casual -2 karma, Core +5 karma
            ↓
  After X Core validations → File = VERIFIED
```

Adds:
- Core Listener role
- Validation queue interface
- Cryptographic proof system
- Karma economy
- Dynamic validation thresholds (popular files need fewer validations)

**Success metric:** Core listeners validate 50+ files, system prevents vote spam

### Phase 3: AI Intelligence (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal:** Learn from validation patterns

Adds:
- AI learns from Core validation decisions
- Ranking algorithm prioritizes verified files
- User preference learning
- Query intent improvements

**Success metric:** Top result is correct 80%+ of time

### Phase 4: Gamification (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal:** Social motivation

Adds:
- Badges (First Core, 100 Validations, Rare Content Seeder)
- Leaderboards (opt-in)
- Public profiles (opt-in)
- Progression milestones

**Success metric:** Users seed longer, vote more, Core recruitment increases

### Phase 5: Economic Sustainability (Month 4+)
**Goal:** Self-sustaining network

```
Revenue Model (IF network achieves scale):

Donations/Crypto
      ↓
Transparent distribution:
  • 95% → Content Creators (artists, labels who opt-in)
  • 5% → Network (split between Core validators & infrastructure)
      ↓
Using blockchain (Solana or similar):
  • Immutable transaction records
  • Transparent allocation
  • Community auditable
  • Team decides details IF traction achieved
```

Adds:
- Fiat/crypto payouts to Core Listeners
- Creator compensation framework (opt-in)
- Foundation/grant funding
- Economic transparency dashboard

**Success metric:** Trusted network established with high-quality validated content, network self-sustains, and transparent creator compensation achieved

---

## 🎓 Core Principles

### 1. Community-Governed, Not Corporate
```
❌ WRONG: Experts decide what's good
✓ RIGHT: Community votes → Core validates with proof
```

- No gatekeepers, only progression paths
- Earn karma → Become Core → Validate
- Transparent validation proofs (auditable)

### 2. Privacy by Default
- Votes are **pseudonymous** (hash of user ID)
- Downloads are **local-only** (SQLite on your machine)
- Identity is **never public** (unless you opt into leaderboards)
- No tracking, no data mining, no surveillance

### 3. Distributed Infrastructure
```
Gun.js Distributed Ledger

Node 1 (You) ←→ Node 2 (Core) ←→ Node 3 (Casual)
      ↓               ↓                ↓
  Local data    Validation        Vote data
      ↓               ↓                ↓
        All nodes sync automatically
              (no central server)
```

- No servers to maintain
- No infrastructure costs at scale
- No single point of failure
- Community runs the nodes

### 4. Open Source & Transparent
- All code is public
- All validation proofs are auditable
- All karma calculations are transparent
- All economic distributions are blockchain-recorded

### 5. Legal & Ethical
- **Respects DMCA takedowns** (network removes flagged content)
- Users responsible for legal compliance in their jurisdiction
- Not a piracy tool — it's music quality validation infrastructure
- Built for music discovery with community trust validation

### 6. Creator-Positive (Future Vision)
- If network achieves scale → transparent creator compensation
- Artists/labels can opt-in to payment distribution
- Blockchain ensures transparency and immutability
- Community decides allocation model

---

### ⚙️ Jackett Setup (Required)

**Karma Player requires a Jackett instance** to search torrent indexers. Jackett is a proxy server that translates queries into tracker-specific formats and aggregates results from 18+ indexers.

#### Option 1: Run Jackett Locally (Recommended for Privacy)

**Installation:**

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install jackett

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install jackett

# Windows: Download from https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/releases

# Start Jackett
jackett

# Access web UI: http://localhost:9117
```

**Configure Indexers:**

1. Open http://localhost:9117 in browser
2. Click "Add Indexer" → Search for indexers (1337x, ThePirateBay, etc.)
3. **Important:** Some indexers require **FlareSolverr** (Cloudflare bypass)
4. Copy your API key from the top-right corner

**FlareSolverr Setup (Optional but Recommended):**

Some indexers (like 1337x) are protected by Cloudflare and require FlareSolverr:

```bash
# Using Docker (easiest)
docker run -d \
  --name=flaresolverr \
  -p 8191:8191 \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=info \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest

# In Jackett, go to Settings → FlareSolverr API URL
# Enter: http://localhost:8191
```

Without FlareSolverr, you'll get "FlareSolverr is not configured" errors for Cloudflare-protected indexers.

**Configure Karma Player:**

During init, enter:
- Jackett URL: `http://localhost:9117`
- API key: (copied from Jackett web interface)

#### Option 2: Use a Remote Jackett Instance

If you're running Jackett on another machine or have access to a shared instance:

```bash
# If using Option 1 (pip install -e .)
karma-player init

# If using Option 2 (poetry)
poetry run karma-player init

# Enter remote URL: https://your-jackett-instance.com
# Enter API key: (provided by instance admin)
```

#### Option 3: Request Team Access (Non-Technical Users)

**Don't have the technical skills or resources to run Jackett?**

Contact the team to request access to a shared Jackett instance:
- **GitHub Issues:** https://github.com/yourusername/karma-player/issues
  - Title: "Request Jackett Remote Access"
  - Include: Brief intro, why you're interested, commitment to learning self-hosting
- **Discord/Email:** [To be announced]

We provide temporary access to help you get started. Once provided:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export JACKETT_REMOTE_URL="https://provided-by-team.com"
export JACKETT_REMOTE_API_KEY="provided-api-key"

# Use remote profile (default)
poetry run karma-player search "radiohead ok computer" --profile remote
```

**Note:** Remote access is temporary and best-effort. We encourage self-hosting for privacy and reliability.

**Why self-hosting is better:**
- Complete privacy (your searches aren't visible to anyone)
- No rate limits or shared capacity issues
- Full control over which indexers to use
- No dependency on external services

### 🎛️ Advanced: Indexer Configuration

Karma Player supports **multiple indexer profiles** via `karma_player/indexers.yaml`. This lets you customize which torrent sources to search and switch between local/remote setups.

#### Default Profiles

**`local`** - Your own Jackett instance
```yaml
profiles:
  local:
    indexers:
      - name: jackett_local
        base_url: http://localhost:9117
        api_key: ${JACKETT_API_KEY}  # From config
        indexer_id: all  # Search all configured indexers
```

**`remote`** - Shared Jackett instance (18+ indexers)
```yaml
profiles:
  remote:  # Default profile
    indexers:
      - knaben, therarbg, torrentgalaxy, 1337x
      - thepiratebay, internetarchive, kickasstorrents
      - mixtapetorrent, nyaa, tokyotoshokan
      # ... 18+ indexers total
```

**`hybrid`** - Query both local and remote
**`lossless_only`** - FLAC/ALAC only (category 3040)

#### Switch Profiles

```bash
# Use local Jackett
poetry run karma-player search "miles davis" --profile local

# Use remote (default)
poetry run karma-player search "miles davis" --profile remote

# Lossless only
poetry run karma-player search "radiohead" --profile lossless_only
```

#### Customize Your Setup

Edit `karma_player/indexers.yaml`:

```yaml
# Change default profile
default_profile: local  # or remote, hybrid, lossless_only

# Add your own indexers
profiles:
  my_custom:
    description: "My personal setup"
    indexers:
      - name: my_jackett
        type: jackett
        enabled: true
        base_url: https://my-server.com:9117
        api_key: your-api-key
        indexer_id: all
        categories: [3040]  # Lossless only
        timeout: 20

# Disable specific indexers
profiles:
  remote:
    indexers:
      - name: thepiratebay
        enabled: false  # Skip this indexer
```

#### Audio Categories

Jackett uses category codes for filtering:
- `3000` - Audio (general)
- `3010` - MP3
- `3040` - **Lossless (FLAC, ALAC)** ← Hi-res audio
- `3020` - Video (music videos)
- `3030` - Audiobooks
- `3050` - Other

**Pro tip:** Use `lossless_only` profile for audiophile searches.

> **Note:** PyPI package coming soon. For now, install from source.

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Search
```bash
poetry run karma-player search "Miles Davis Kind of Blue"
```

AI finds the canonical album, searches 18+ indexers, returns best FLAC.

### Format Preference
```bash
# Prefer FLAC, fallback to MP3 if none found
poetry run karma-player search "Pink Floyd Dark Side" --format FLAC

# ONLY FLAC (strict, no fallback)
poetry run karma-player search "Radiohead OK Computer" --format FLAC --strict
```

### Auto-Mode (Let AI Handle Everything)
```bash
poetry run karma-player search "fear of the dark iron maiden"
# Select album → Choose [4] Just get it for me!
# System tries: single track → album → other albums
```

### Fast Mode (Skip MusicBrainz)
```bash
poetry run karma-player search "esperanza spalding" --skip-musicbrainz --min-seeders 5
```

Direct torrent search. Faster but less accurate.

### Check Configuration
```bash
poetry run karma-player config show
```

## 🤝 How This Compares

### vs Spotify / Apple Music
- **Them:** You rent access. They decide what's available.
- **Us:** Community owns the trust network. You decide what to download.

### vs What.CD / Redacted
- **Them:** Interview process. Invite trees. Ratio requirements. Expert gatekeeping.
- **Us:** Open access (donation or invitation). Two-tier validation. Anyone can progress to Core.

### vs Public Torrent Sites
- **Them:** 50 results. No quality control. Decision paralysis. Fake files.
- **Us:** Network validates once. Everyone benefits forever. AI picks best match.

### vs Soulseek
- **Complementary, not competing**
- Soulseek serves audiophiles well (by design, technically complex to maintain quality)
- We believe casual listeners deserve awesome audio too
- Our goal: Make BEST audio quality accessible to everyone through community validation
- If Soulseek wants to integrate as a search source, we're open (MusicBrainz metadata + trust validation could complement their network)

### What Makes TTN Different

```
Private Trackers:  Quality ✓  Access ✗  (gatekeeping)
Public Torrents:   Access ✓  Quality ✗  (no validation)
Trust Tune:        Access ✓  Quality ✓  (community validation)
```

**The bet:** Combining MusicBrainz (canonical metadata) + distributed validation (community proof) + AI (intent understanding) creates something better than gatekeeping OR anarchy.

## 💭 Philosophy: Building Trust at Scale

> *"The internet has infinite content. The problem isn't access — it's knowing what/where to trust."*

### The Old Model: Gatekeeping
```
Private trackers solved quality with exclusivity:
  Interviews → Invite trees → Ratio requirements
        ↓
  Only "experts" validate
        ↓
  High quality, low accessibility
```

### The New Model: Community Validation
```
Trust Tune solves quality with distributed proof:
  Casual votes → Core validates with proof → Network trusts
        ↓
  Anyone can participate at their level
        ↓
  High quality, high accessibility
```

### Why This Works

**Network effects:**
- More users → More votes → More validation work
- More Core Listeners → Faster validation → More verified files
- More verified files → Better search results → More users

**Economic alignment:**
- Casuals benefit from validated network
- Core benefits from compensation (future)
- Creators benefit from transparent payments (future)
- Everyone benefits from trust infrastructure

**Technical soundness:**
- Cryptographic proofs prevent spam
- Pseudonymous votes preserve privacy
- Distributed ledger prevents censorship
- Open source enables auditing

**Social scalability:**
- Two-tier system separates participation levels
- Karma progression creates clear path to Core
- Transparent validation builds trust
- Community governance prevents capture

---

## 🌍 Focus: Music Quality First

**Karma Player is built specifically for music.**

Why music?
- Clear, measurable quality metrics (format, bitrate, spectral analysis)
- Canonical metadata already exists (MusicBrainz)
- Passionate community (audiophiles) ready to validate
- Acoustic fingerprinting tech is mature (Chromaprint)
- Audio quality matters deeply to listeners

The validation principles *could* theoretically apply to other content types (software integrity, document preservation, educational materials), but **we're laser-focused on music**. Better to do one thing exceptionally well than many things poorly.

---

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Framework

### DMCA Compliance
- Network respects DMCA takedown requests
- Flagged content removed from distributed ledger
- Users notified of removals (transparency)
- Appeal process for false positives

### User Responsibility
- Users responsible for legal compliance in their jurisdiction
- Tool facilitates search and metadata, not distribution
- No hosting, no storage, no servers

### Creator Compensation (Detailed)

*See [Why This Exists](#-why-this-exists-empowering-creators-not-exploiting-them) for the full vision.*

**Summary:**
- **Phase 0-2:** Free for everyone, build trust infrastructure
- **Phase 3+:** Optional paid tier (premium features)
- **Revenue split:** 95% creators, 5% network
- **Full transparency:** Open analytics + blockchain payments
- **No ads, ever**

Artists control what's shared (opt-in per song/album) and receive direct compensation when revenue exists.
