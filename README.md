## What and Why

> **Music discovery doesn't have a quality problem‚Äîit has a trust problem.**

You can stream anything on Spotify, but artists get **$0.003 per play**. You can find FLAC torrents, but which ones are real? Which are transcodes? Which uploaders are trusted?

**TrustTune solves this:**

- üó£Ô∏è Search naturally ("radiohead ok computer flac") or precisely (`SELECT album WHERE artist="Radiohead" AND format="FLAC"`)
- üéØ AI ranks by actual quality (DSD > FLAC 24-bit > FLAC > MP3 320)
- üéµ Built-in player, auto-organized library, zero config
- üåê **Protocol-first**: Like BitTorrent, anyone can run a node
- üí∞ **Endgame**: 95% revenue to artists (Phase 3+)

This is **Phase 0.5** of a larger vision. Today: Beautiful app. Tomorrow: Decentralized trust network. Future: Fair creator economy.

---

## The Problem

**Streaming services:**
- Artists earn $0.003/stream (~300 plays = $1)
- Compressed audio (256kbps AAC)
- Pay $10/month forever, own nothing

**Torrents:**
- High quality available (FLAC, hi-res)
- Complex (torrent clients, VPNs, ratios)
- **No trust**: Fake files, transcodes, malware
- Hard to find, hard to verify

## The Solution

> **TrustTune = AI-powered search + Quality verification + Fair compensation**

We're building this in phases. Each phase works standalone, each builds toward the vision.

### Phase 0.5 ‚Äî Available Now

**Desktop app with two interfaces:**
- Talk: *"radiohead ok computer flac"*
- Query: `SELECT album WHERE artist="Radiohead" AND format="FLAC"`

Both get you the same results: AI-ranked, quality-scored, ready to play.

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Searches 18+ sources in parallel (Jackett, 1337x, more via plugins)
- ‚úÖ AI ranks by real quality (not just file size)
- ‚úÖ MusicBrainz metadata (35M+ recordings)
- ‚úÖ Built-in player + auto-tagging
- ‚úÖ **Bundled Transmission** - No separate installation!
- ‚úÖ Works out of the box (your grandma could use it)

### Phases 1-3 ‚Äî The Vision

**Phase 1:** Community trust network (like Wikipedia for music quality)
**Phase 2:** Federation protocol (anyone can run a node)
**Phase 3:** Creator payments (95% to artists, not Spotify's $0.003)

---

## Installation

### Desktop App (Recommended)

**One-click install for macOS, Windows, Linux:**

| Platform | Download | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **macOS** | [Download ZIP](https://github.com/trust-tune-net/karma-player/releases/latest/download/TrustTune-macOS.zip) | Intel & Apple Silicon |
| **Windows** | [Download ZIP](https://github.com/trust-tune-net/karma-player/releases/latest/download/TrustTune-Windows.zip) | Windows 10/11 |
| **Linux** | [Download TAR.GZ](https://github.com/trust-tune-net/karma-player/releases/latest/download/TrustTune-Linux.tar.gz) | Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora |

> **‚úÖ Everything Included:** TrustTune now comes with Transmission bundled - just download, extract, and run! No separate installation needed. See **[Setup Guide](SETUP.md)** for details.

### CLI (For Power Users)

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install karma-player

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/trust-tune-net/karma-player.git
cd karma-player && pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

### Desktop App ‚Äî Two Ways to Search

**Natural Language** (talk like a human):
```
radiohead ok computer flac
miles davis kind of blue 24-bit
pink floyd dark side vinyl rip
```

**SQL-Like** (query like a database):
```sql
SELECT album WHERE artist="Radiohead" AND format="FLAC"
SELECT track WHERE title="Paranoid Android" ORDER BY seeders DESC
SELECT album WHERE artist="Miles Davis" AND year BETWEEN 1955 AND 1965
```

Both interfaces ‚Üí Same AI-ranked results ‚Üí Built-in player ‚Üí Done.

### CLI ‚Äî For Power Users & Scripts

```bash
# Natural language
karma-player search "radiohead ok computer flac"

# SQL-like
karma-player query 'SELECT album WHERE artist="Radiohead" AND format="FLAC"'

# Advanced options
karma-player search "miles davis" --full-ai --min-seeders 10 --skip-musicbrainz
```

**Example output:**
```
üéµ Found 47 results, showing top 10:

‚úÖ #1 Radiohead - OK Computer (1997)
   üíé FLAC 24-bit/96kHz | 1.4 GB | 52 seeders
   üèÜ Best quality ‚Ä¢ Verified uploader
   magnet:?xt=urn:btih:...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Setup Jackett (Optional)

For best results, run Jackett locally:

```bash
# Install Jackett
# macOS: brew install jackett
# Windows: Download from https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/releases

# Configure in TrustTune
export JACKETT_URL="http://localhost:9117"
export JACKETT_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for AI features
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."           # OpenAI API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."   # Anthropic API key

# Optional
export JACKETT_URL="http://localhost:9117"
export JACKETT_API_KEY="..."
export MUSICBRAINZ_API_KEY="..."        # For faster MusicBrainz queries
```

---

## üé® How It Works

```
Your Query (Natural Language OR SQL-like)
    ‚Üì
Natural Language: AI parsing ("radiohead ok computer")
SQL-like: Direct parsing (SELECT album WHERE artist="Radiohead")
    ‚Üì
MusicBrainz Lookup (Canonical Metadata)
    ‚Üì
Multi-Source Search (18+ Indexers + DHT)
    ‚Üì
AI Quality Ranking (FLAC 24-bit > 16-bit > MP3 320)
    ‚Üì
Best Results with AI Explanations
```

**Two Search Modes:**
- **Natural Language** - For everyone (even grandma): "radiohead ok computer flac"
- **SQL-Like** - For power users: `SELECT album WHERE artist="Radiohead" AND format="FLAC"`

Both modes produce the same high-quality results, just different input styles.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI
- **Desktop:** Flutter (cross-platform)
- **Search:** Plugin architecture (Jackett, 1337x, DHT - easy to add more)
- **AI:** OpenAI + Anthropic (Groq for speed)
- **Metadata:** MusicBrainz API
- **Player:** media_kit (MPV)
- **Architecture:** See [Plugin Architecture](docs/PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md) for adding sources

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal

TrustTune is a **decentralized protocol and open-source software** for music discovery and artist compensation. Like BitTorrent, email, or the web itself, it's a protocol that anyone can implement.

**What TrustTune is:**
- A protocol specification (like HTTP, SMTP, BitTorrent)
- Open-source reference implementation
- A vision for fair creator compensation
- Community-driven, decentralized infrastructure

**What we do NOT do:**
- Host any copyrighted content
- Circumvent DRM or encryption
- Encourage piracy or copyright infringement
- Control what users download

**User Responsibility:**
Users are solely responsible for ensuring their downloads comply with local laws and regulations. TrustTune facilitates search and discovery of publicly available content, similar to web search engines or torrent clients.

**DMCA Compliance:**
We respect intellectual property rights and respond to valid DMCA takedown notices. If you believe content indexed by TrustTune infringes your copyright, please contact us with a proper DMCA notice.

**This project is for:**
- Building decentralized music discovery protocols
- Researching fair creator compensation models
- Educational and academic purposes
- Discovering public domain and Creative Commons music
- Finding legitimately free content (indie artists, demos, live recordings)

## Why This Matters

> **Music has a trust problem, not a technology problem.**

The tools exist. Spotify has great UX. Torrents have great quality. MusicBrainz has great metadata. But:
- **Listeners** overpay for compressed audio and own nothing
- **Artists** get $0.003 per stream (~$3,000 for 1M plays)
- **Quality** is unverified (fake FLACs, transcodes everywhere)

**TrustTune fixes this step by step:**

**Phase 0.5 (Now):** Beautiful app that finds quality automatically
**Phase 1-2 (Soon):** Community trust network + federation protocol
**Phase 3+ (Vision):** Fair creator economy (95% to artists)

### Not Building a Company

We're building a **protocol**, like BitTorrent or email:
- Anyone can implement it
- Anyone can run a node
- No single point of control
- Open source, transparent

**Start simple. Scale responsibly. Stay ethical.**
