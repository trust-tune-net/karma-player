            ## 🎵 KarmaPlayer Release

            **AI-powered music discovery with built-in player**

            ### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: macOS Installation

            **1. Choose the Correct Version for Your Mac:**
            
            - Click Apple menu () → **About This Mac**
            - Look at the **Chip** or **Processor** line:
              - **Intel** processor (2020 and earlier) → Download **Intel** version
              - **Apple M1/M2/M3** (2020+) → Download **AppleSilicon** version

            **2. First Launch Security Warning:**
            
            macOS will show a security warning on first launch. This is normal for open-source apps.

            **To fix (choose ONE method):**

            1. **Right-click method** (easiest): Right-click `KarmaPlayer.app` → Open → Click "Open" in dialog
            2. **Terminal method**: Run `xattr -cr /path/to/KarmaPlayer.app`

            **Why?** Apple requires a $99/year Developer Program to avoid this. As an open-source project, we don't pay for that. The app is safe - you can review the code on GitHub.

            📄 See `MACOS_INSTALL.txt` (included in download) for detailed instructions.

            ### 🎉 What's New in v${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
